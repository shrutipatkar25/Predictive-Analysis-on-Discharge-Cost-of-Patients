# Predictive-Analysis-on-Discharge-Cost-of-Patients in R
In this project, I have used multiple regression analysis to predict the discharge cost of patients based on Age, Gender and Length of Stay.
I have used the publicaly available dataset from Kaggle. The link to the dataset is given below:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravichaubey1506/healthcare-cost

The complete project can be summarized in following steps.

1. Import the Dataset in R
2. Understand the Dataset
3. Using Regression Analysis
4. Predicting discharge cost with the help of regression model
5. Understanding the reason behind the gap between real and predicted values
6. Providing conclusion

I have also written a article on the entire process of Predictive Analysis. The link to the article is given below:
