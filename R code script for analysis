## Predictive Analysis on discharge cost ##

# Step 1: Import dataset
library(readr)
discharge_cost <- read_csv("discharge cost.csv")
View(discharge_cost)

#Step 2: Understand dataset and variables
 # to understand structure of data points
str(discharge_cost)
 # to view summary of the data points
summary(discharge_cost) 
 # to view no of male & female patients
table_gender<- table(discharge_cost$GENDER) 
table_gender

#Step 3: Performing linear regression
 # performing linear regression on the data variables
 # TOTCHG is discharge cost which is predictor variable
 # Age, Gender, LOS are response variable
model1 <- lm(TOTCHG ~ AGE + GENDER + LOS, data = discharge_cost)
summary(model1)

#Step 4: Using our model for prediction
 # predicting the discharge cost using the model
predict(model1)
 # predicting discharge cost by giving specific input values
predict(model1, tibble(AGE = 17, GENDER = 'Male', LOS = 7))
 # comparing predicted values with real values
predicted_values<- data_frame(predict(model1))
 # adding predicted value column to the dataset
discharge_cost$predicted <- predicted_values

#Step 5: Understanding the reason behind the variation in cost
 # installing packages for visualization
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
 # creating visualizations
ggplot(data = discharge_cost,aes(x = AGE, y = TOTCHG, col = GENDER)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(data = discharge_cost,aes(x = LOS, y = TOTCHG, z = AGE, col = GENDER)) +
  geom_point()
hist(discharge_cost$AGE)
hist(discharge_cost$LOS)
hist(discharge_cost$TOTCHG)

``Conclusion: We can only predict 43% of variation in discharge cost with the given response variables as the data points are not linearly distributes``
``To predict discharge cost more effectively we need to look for other parameters``
