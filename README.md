# Predictive-Analysis-on-Discharge-Cost-of-Patients in R
In this project, I have used multiple regression analysis to predict the discharge cost of patients based on Age, Gender and Length of Stay.
I have used the publicaly available dataset from Kaggle. The link to the dataset is given below:

The complete project can be summarized in following steps.

Step 1: Import the Dataset in R
Step 2: Understand the Dataset
Step 3: Using Regression Analysis
Step 4: Predicting discharge cost with the help of regression model
Step 5: Understanding the reason behind the gap between real and predicted values
Step 6: Providing conclusion

I have also written a article on the entire process of Predictive Analysis. The link to the article is given below:
